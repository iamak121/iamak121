Hi, I'm Abhishek Koundle!
Data Analyst | 1.9+ Years of Experience | Building Insights with Data

I'm a passionate data analyst with a 1.9+ year track record of unlocking insights from data. After graduating from Chandigarh University, I dived headfirst into the world of data, honing my skills in:

Excel: A master of formulas and data manipulation, I can wrangle spreadsheets like a pro.
Power BI: I turn raw data into compelling visualizations that tell a story and drive action.
SQL: I speak the language of databases, querying and extracting valuable information with precision.
